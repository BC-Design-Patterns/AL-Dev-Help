## Business Central Design Patterns & Best Practices

This site is meant to house some of the community's knowledge about Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central AL Development best practices, particularly around hosting Design Patterns.

### What are Design Patterns?

To quote the original NAV Team blog post about the NAV Design Patterns:

> A team of people interested in NAV application design has come together to work on naming and surfacing design solutions to common NAV business needs. When those solutions are generic enough to be applied in various places of the NAV application, with slight variations on implementation but mainly respecting the same base concepts, we can describe them as NAV design patterns.

A design pattern is a repeatable template of how to solve a common development challenge.

### History of "NAV Design Patterns"

In 2013, Microsoft NAV Dev Team and prominent members of the community collaborated on a Community and Microsoft collection of commonly needed / used Design Patterns.

For some history on this, Waldo's posts [Code is Poetry](https://www.waldo.be/2013/06/14/code-is-poetry/) and [Design is Philosophy](https://www.waldo.be/2013/08/28/design-is-philosophy-2/) are a great read.
