Despite that, some are still being used today by developers everywhere.
&amp;ldquo;An anti-pattern (or antipattern) is a common response to a recurring problem that is usually ineffective and risks being highly counterproductive&amp;rdquo; (from Wikipedia)
Since almost the beginning of the NAV Design Patterns project, we talked about documenting the anti-patterns - but never found the time.

CAL Coding Guidelines</title><link>https://bc-design-patterns.github.io/AL-Dev-Help/navpatterns/3-cal-coding-guidelines/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bc-design-patterns.github.io/AL-Dev-Help/navpatterns/3-cal-coding-guidelines/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve decided to publish our current C/AL coding guidelines. They are actual, as per January 2015 when this is published (but might fall out of sync as time goes by).
You can also download the C/AL coding guidelines as pdf, all in one document. In contrast, on this wiki, the coding guidelines are published individually. The reason is: give you the chance to comment and share your oppinion on each one.</description></item><item><title>(OLD) Get Involved</title><link>https://bc-design-patterns.github.io/AL-Dev-Help/navpatterns/4-get-involved/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bc-design-patterns.github.io/AL-Dev-Help/navpatterns/4-get-involved/</guid><description>Reminder, this is an ARCHIVE of the Patterns site, this information is not current.

NAV Design Patterns are excellent materials for training and knowledge transfer. In your company, you can help new developer get to speed with NAV by recommending them to read and then present to the team one of the most common patterns: No. Series, Setup Table and definitely Hooks which will be a great investment in reducing your upgrade time.</description></item><item><title>Related Links</title><link>https://bc-design-patterns.github.io/AL-Dev-Help/navpatterns/related-links/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bc-design-patterns.github.io/AL-Dev-Help/navpatterns/related-links/</guid><description>Find below some related NAV Design Patterns links.
